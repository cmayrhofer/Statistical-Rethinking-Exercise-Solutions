# Statistical-Rethinking-Exercise-Solutions
In this repository we collect the solutions (so far done) to the exercises which are provided
in the book "Statistical Rethinking---A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan." The website,
which goes with this book, can be found [here](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/).
Furthermore, the author presented the content of the book also as lecture of which the records can
be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdNM4Edgs7weiyIguLSToZRI).


Contrary to the book title, we solved the problems by means of [Pyro](http://pyro.ai/). Getting
ourselves familiarised with Pyro was also the main intention behind working out all these examples
explicitly.
